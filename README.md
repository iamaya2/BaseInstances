# BaseInstances
Repository with instances to use as a base for checking implementations

Define a folder per combinatorial problem and put information inside. 

Provide instance data and expected solution (with/without heuristics), and as much information as possible. If feasible, provide instance as a loadable file and as a text file. In the former, provide a readme with information about how to read such a file.
